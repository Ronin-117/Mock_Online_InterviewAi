Gemini Response 0: Good morning Neil. Thanks for being here today.To start, can you tell me about a time you faced a significant challenge in a project and how you overcame it?
Gemini Response 1: Could you describe a difficult problem you encountered while working on a project and explain the steps you took to solve it?
Gemini Response 2: Okay,that is completely fine. This will be the last question.Can you describe a situation where you had to work with someone who had a very different working style than you, and how did you navigate that situation to achieve a common goal?
