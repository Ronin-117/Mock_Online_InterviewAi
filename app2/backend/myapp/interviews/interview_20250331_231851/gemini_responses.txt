Gemini Response 0: Good morning.Thanks for being here today.Let's start with something broad: Can you tell me about a time you faced a significant setback in a project and how you handled it? I'm interested in understanding your problem-solving approach and resilience.
Gemini Response 1: I understand you might not want to delve into past setbacks, but reflecting on challenges is often a valuable learning experience.Perhaps you could instead describe a situation where you had to quickly adapt to unexpected changes in a project's scope or requirements? This is the last question.
