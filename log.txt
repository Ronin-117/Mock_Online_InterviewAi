1. testing faster-whisper = installed faster-whisper, its req, ran the first example code
	install torch gpu for some reason - useless
	solved OMP: Error by reinstalling numpy
	faster-whisper is fast but some accuracy issues 
	implemented some real time transcribing
	made it use accumulative audio tracription to make good use of attention mechanism of whisper
